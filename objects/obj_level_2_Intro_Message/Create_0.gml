show_message("You made it to The Catacombs!\n\nThis is where the game starts getting harder.\n\nEnemies now spawn faster and move towards you faster. Lucky for you there is a weapon that you can use to defend yourself.\n(Use SPACE BAR to shoot)\n\nThe goal for this level is to reach room 13. Try using a similar strategy and watch out for trap rooms.\n\nOnce you reach room 13, you will be teleported to The Graveyard.\n\nGood luck!");
